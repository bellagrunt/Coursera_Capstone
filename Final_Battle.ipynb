It's the largest city by population in Oregon with different industries thriving. A client came to me asking if I could gather data on where to put her man-bikini coffee cafe called, \"Zulu Bikini Cafe\". It's an unique cafe where men are dressed in man-bikinis and serve coffee and other food items to customers. She picked Portland, Oregon because there's more of a population of females than males. So to her advantage she can advertise her coffee with men in sexy bathing suits serving coffee to customers.",

I will also download data from portlandoregon.com that will provide neighborhoods, population of Portland, and how many females vs males in Portland. I will be using foursquare to populate all the cafes in different neihgborhoods. Finally I will then use the data I've gathered from neighborghood and the population and show her where to strategically place her business. I will do so by showing neighborhoods with the highest population with the least amount of cafes in X area. \n\nOregon Population: \nhttp://worldpopulationreview.com/states/oregon-population/\n\nPortland Population and neighborhoods:\nhttps://www.portlandoregon.gov/civic/article/376383\n\nFoursquare cafes in Portland Oregon:\nhttps://foursquare.com/explore?mode=url&near=Portland%2C%20OR%2C%20United%20States&nearGeoId=72057594043674481&q=cafe",
